                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4"> Primary as well as secondary research was used for this study. Initially, a list of manufacturers and suppliers operating in the Agarbatti and Dhoop market of India were sourced through secondary sources. With the identified companies and consumers, primary research was carried out which included conducting online surveys, competitor analysis and exhaustive personal interviews - both face to face as well as over the telephone, to extract maximum information from participants like industry executives/ distributors or consumers. Primary research gave us an idea of company revenues, export, pricing, geographical presence, channel partner model, USP etc. and also helped us to identify various small players who otherwise have less presence on the web.
    
                  Secondary data was also sought from third-party sources such as published articles, company websites, magazine articles, associations, trade journals, annual reports, government official websites and other paid database sources. In addition, data is also mined from a host of reports in our repository, as well as a number of paid databases of the Indian government. Using both primary and secondary information, the size of the market was calculated through a bottom-up approach, where manufacturersâ€™ value sales data for different types of Agarbatti and Dhoop were recorded and subsequently forecasted for the future years.
